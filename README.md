# Object-Recognition-with-CNN-using-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
computer vision system that can recognize and classify objects in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project involve training a CNN model using TensorFlow, and then using OpenCV to apply the model for real-time object recognition through a webcam
